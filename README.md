Hello, I am Furkan Ã‡etin. I am a Junior Full-Stack Engineer with a backend focus and also have a keen interest in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am competent in all stages of the software development process, but I specialize in backend development in particular.
I constantly improve myself in AI and ML and strive to apply these technologies in my projects. With my passion for technology and my desire to constantly learn, I aim to produce innovative and effective solutions.
